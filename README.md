# Prerequisites

- The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserved that data in the Arctic Code Vault. :smile:

Writers often keep journals to record observations and explore ideas that may eventually be developed into more formal essays, articles, and stories.

# Behaviour Bug Tracking

- In some cases prosecutor can be also a persecutor, when prosecutor exploits laws and his/her network in both worlds (ying and yang) to harass someone so he/her stays on governement payroll or for job promotion. For example: exploiting EU law about disease (COVID), exploiting EU laws about nationalities, exploiting laws in the countries you visit if you are travelling, etc. For instance "Pachamama" who works as a legal officer at the Office of the Prosecutor at the United Nations stuidies torture. She can use that knowledge to protect innocents people or in certain case use it to perscute (torture) mentally a victim (persecution, tricks, media, information manipulation, etc).

# Behaviour Driven Development Testing
Let's show some examples of stories that we call "vespa contacts" using BDD:

### 1. User story: As a user I want to see all the entries in the vespa contacts
```
Scenario: Show all the people in the contacts list
  Given "All the requirements are satisfied and installed"
  When "I run `python3 vespa_contacts list`"
  Then "I will see all the entries in the vespa contacts"
```

### 2. User story: As a user I want to add a new entry in the vespa contacts
```
Scenario: Add another use in my contacts
  Given "All the requirements are satisfied and installed"
  When "I run `python3 vespa_contacts add <name>`"
  Then "I will add a new entry in my contacts"
  
Example:
  python3 vespa_contacts add samu
  python3 vespa_contacts add police
  python3 vespa_contacts add carrefour
  python3 vespa_contacts add caf
  python3 vespa_contacts add secu
  python3 vespa_contacts add linkedin
```

### 3. User story: As a user I want see a contact location
```
Scenario: Add another use in my contacts
  Given "All the requirements are satisfied and installed"
  When "I run `python3 vespa_contacts find <name>`"
  Then "I will see the location of that person"
  
Example:
  python3 vespa_contacts find gaia
  python3 vespa_contacts find thomas
  python3 vespa_contacts find sebastien
```
